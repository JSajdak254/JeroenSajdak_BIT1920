Give the name of the gene with the most exons? Give the number of exons of this gene?

sql> SELECT gene_name, count(exon_id) AS exon_count FROM gene AS g JOIN transcript AS t ON g.gene_id=t.gene_id JOIN exon_transcript AS et on et.transcript_id=t.transcript_id GROUP BY g.gene_id ORDER BY count(exon_id) DESC LIMIT 1;
+-----------+------------+
| gene_name | exon_count |
+-----------+------------+
| SYNE1     |       1415 |
